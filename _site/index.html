  Welcome to MSP Toy Design! Below you will find a course information and the schedule–complete with links to resources. Additional information and student work can be found on the list to your left, and a PDF download of the full syllabus can be found at the bottom of the page. 
  </p> 

<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>
This exciting new camp offers young toy designers the opportunity to draw, sculpt, digitally model, and prototype their own action figure. Campers will first develop a character by creating a series of traditional illustrations and models, and then they will draw the toy version of the character at scale using drafting conventions and equipment. Afterwards, using 3D-modeling software, students will produce a 3D model of their toy, its accessories, and its packaging. A plastic prototype of each camper’s character will be produced using model-making technology at SAIC’s Advanced Output Center.
